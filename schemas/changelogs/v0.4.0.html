<ul>
    <li>
        Separate detection and tracking records as different types, for more flexibility on what either can contain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enforce the <span class="code">alarm</span> member on tracking records. Leaving it as null on tracking records
        previously resulted in implementation defined behavior; This is no longer the case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the <span class="code">location</span> member optional on detection records, as some C-UAS systems may
        sometimes detect UAS systems and some of their details but not know their exact location.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rename <span class="code">alarm_certainty</span> in <span class="code">alarm</span> members to <span
            class="code">certainty</span>. This was an oversight on 0.3.0 and thus has been fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <a href="https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html">externally tagged enum representation</a> for
        <span class="code">location</span> members, which may be clearer in documentation and easier to work with in
        some OOP languages.
    </li>
