<ul>
    <li>
        Separate detection and tracking records as different types, for more flexibility on what either can contain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enforce the <span class="code">alarm</span> member on tracking records. Leaving it as null on tracking records
        previously resulted in implementation defined behavior; This is no longer the case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the <span class="code">location</span> member optional on detection records, as some C-UAS systems may
        sometimes detect UAS systems and some of their details but not know their exact location.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rename <span class="code">alarm_certainty</span> in <span class="code">alarm</span> members to <span
            class="code">certainty</span>. This was an oversight on 0.3.0 and thus has been fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rename <span class="code">location</span> tag member from <span class="code">t</span> to <span
            class="code">$type</span>, which is a bit more explicit on its meaning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <a href="https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html">internally tagged enum representation</a> for
        <span class="code">location</span> members, which effectively gets rid of the `c` member, flattening its
        contents into the parent structure.
        This means that what previously was represented as
        <div class="code">
            "t": "Position3d",<br />
            "c": {<br />
            "lat": 0.1234,<br />
            "lon": 0.1234,<br />
            "height_amsl": 0.1234<br />
            }
        </div>
        Is now represented as
        <div class="code">
            "$type": "Position3d",<br />
            "lat": 0.1234,<br />
            "lon": 0.1234,<br />
            "height_amsl": 0.1234
        </div>
